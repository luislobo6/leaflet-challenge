 Visualizing Data with Leaflet
 =======

 In this project we took data from the USGS system to plot on a map a query of 7 days of earthquakes in two stages:

1. Just ploting the earthquakes and their magnitudes (represented by size and color) and with geo possitions
2. Ploting the same results adding the tectonic plates and some user friendly configurations selectable on the top right of the map
